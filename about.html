                <h1>About</h1>
                <p><a href="https://gpxstudio.github.io" target="_blank"><b>gpx.studio</b></a> is a free online GPX viewer and editor which allows to :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>visualize multiple traces in different colors and aided by many different maps (cycling, hiking, satellite, <a href="https://www.strava.com/heatmap" target="_blank">Strava heatmap</a> overlay, etc)</li>
                    <li>edit traces by adding, inserting, moving or deleting points</li>
                    <li>reverse traces</li>
                    <li>add timestamps to a trace</li>
                    <li>view, add, edit and remove waypoints</li>
                    <li>automatically add elevation data to traces if missing</li>
                    <li>merge multiple traces or export them separately, extending time, heart rate, cadence and temperature data where needed</li>
                    <li>save the result on your computer or to your Google Drive to get a shareable link and embedding code</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is a one-person side project created after messing with GPX files for some time. If you like the tool and use it frequently, please consider <a href="https://paypal.me/vcoppe" target="_blank" onclick="gtag('event', 'about', {'event_category' : 'donate'});">donating</a> as to cover bills from API calls (map display, routing and elevation features) and encourage me to keep improving the website. Thank you for your support!</p>
                <p>The project source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/gpxstudio/gpxstudio.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a> where I also put future developments.
