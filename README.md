This repository contains the source code of the website [gpx.studio](https://gpx.studio), an online tool for GPX editing.

![Preview of the online app.](res/preview.png)

## Run the code

To play with the code locally:
* Get your own tokens at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [GraphHopper](https://www.graphhopper.com/) and put them in `res/keys.json`.
* Launch a local server in the root directory, for example using `python3 -m http.server`.

## Features

* Load, edit and create new GPX files
* Change the starting time and speed of the activity
* Reverse the direction of a trace
* Reduce the number of track points
* Merge multiple traces together
* Support for waypoints: place and drag, edit information, duplicate
* Support for track segments (`<trkseg>`) : extraction with smart waypoints matching and merge as track segments
* Delete points and/or waypoints inside or outside a rectangle selection
* Export multiple traces as one or separately in the chosen order and respecting time precedence constraints (if any time data)
* Preserve and automatically extend speed, heart rate, cadence, power and temperature data
* Drag and drop to load and export files
* Support as many traces as you want with scrollable tabs
* Google Drive integration and [add-on](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/gpxstudio_the_online_gpx_editor/666808960580): select a file, save the new version and get a shareable link as well as code to embed the map

## Contributing

If you think something is missing from the website, please create an issue to discuss it or make a pull request if you can implement it yourself.

## Translation

The website is translated by volunteers on a collaborative translation platform.
You can help complete and improve the translations by joining the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/gpxstudio).
If you would like to start the translation in a new language, contact me or create an issue.
Apart from a good understanding of **gpx.studio**, some basic knowledge of HTML can be useful. Any help is greatly appreciated!
